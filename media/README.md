# Media
A social Media Managing platform


I created a social media managing platform that simplifies managing multiple social media profiles. Users enter their username, and the platform generates a detailed card displaying their social media information. This card includes profile pictures, follower counts, and recent posts from various platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn. The platform integrates seamlessly with these social networks, allowing users to view and manage their social presence in one place. It saves time, enhances efficiency, and provides a comprehensive overview of social media activities, making it easier to maintain an active and engaging online presence.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
